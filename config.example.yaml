# Example SuhaibServer Configuration

# SniSniffer controls how we read the first few bytes of an incoming connection
# to detect the SNI (Server Name Indication).
SniSniffer:
  # MaxReadSize is the maximum number of bytes to peek from the client
  # to extract the SNI. If the SNI can't be found within this range,
  # the connection is closed or handled as an error.
  MaxReadSize: 4096

  # Timeout is how long (e.g. 5s, 500ms, etc.) we wait for TLS handshake data
  # when sniffing for SNI. If this timeout is exceeded, we fail the connection.
  Timeout: 5s

# Hooks are registered in your Go code (see README) and referenced by name here.
Hooks:
  - name: auth
    kind: on_request_received
    match:
      host: example.com
      path_prefix: /admin
      methods: [GET, POST]
    timeout: 800ms
  - name: metrics
    kind: on_request_completed
    match:
      host: example.com

# Backends is a list of per-hostname configurations, each describing
# how to handle connections to a particular SNI.
Backends:
  - hostname: example.com

    # If mTLS is enabled, we consult MTLSPolicy to see which paths or
    # queries require (or exclude) client certificates.
    MTLSEnabled: true

    # The MTLSPolicy below means: by default, do NOT require mTLS (Default=false),
    # but invert that default if the path starts with `/admin` or if the query param
    # "token" is present—those routes *will* require mTLS.
    MTLSPolicy:
      Default: false
      Paths:
        - /admin
      Queries:
        - token

    # TerminateTLS=true means SuhaibServer will handle TLS termination locally
    # (i.e., present cert/key) and then forward plain HTTP (or HTTPS) to the Origin.
    TerminateTLS: true
    TLSCertFile: example.com.crt
    TLSKeyFile: example.com.key

    # RootCAFile is used to verify client certificates if mTLS is triggered.
    # If you leave it blank, partial mTLS still works (the handshake won't *force*
    # a client cert). This is just an example path.
    RootCAFile: ca.crt

    # OriginScheme indicates whether to connect to the origin via HTTP or HTTPS.
    OriginScheme: http

    # OriginServer / OriginPort describe where to forward traffic after TLS termination.
    # For example, maybe your app is running on localhost:8080 inside the container.
    OriginServer: 127.0.0.1
    OriginPort: "8080"

    # Configure which hooks should run for this backend.
    Hooks:
      on_request_received: [auth]
      on_request_completed: [metrics]

  - hostname: foo.bar
    # In this example, we do NOT enable mTLS or TLS termination for foo.bar,
    # which means we do a raw TCP pass-through to the origin.
    MTLSEnabled: false
    TerminateTLS: false

    # Because we are not terminating TLS, these fields are optional or unused:
    # TLSCertFile, TLSKeyFile, RootCAFile
    # They can be omitted or left blank in YAML if you wish.

    # The origin is presumably a TLS-enabled service on 192.168.0.10:443.
