**SuhaibServer** is a reverse proxy designed to simplify and enhance TLS and mTLS (Mutual TLS) management beyond what is typically possible in solutions like NGINX or Apache. By leveraging **SNI (Server Name Indication)**, SuhaibServer allows you to define highly granular routing and security policies per domain—right down to specific URLs and query parameters.

---

## Key Features

### Advanced SNI Routing
- **Route incoming connections** based on SNI immediately.  
- **Simplify your configuration** by grouping all TLS/mTLS rules according to the hostname.

### Flexible TLS & mTLS Options
- **TCP Pass-Through**: Let the origin server handle TLS/mTLS completely.  
- **TLS Termination**: Terminate TLS at SuhaibServer, and pass requests on to the origin via HTTP or HTTPS.  
- **Granular mTLS**: Enforce mTLS on a per-path or per-query-parameter basis, or allow requests through without client certificates.

### Customizable Certificate Validation
- **Configure different root CAs** for each hostname or route.  
- **Control certificate validation** behavior for one service without affecting another.

### High-Granularity Policy Management
- **Easily combine criteria** such as routes, query parameters, SNI, and more.  
- **Use logical conditions** to decide whether to perform mTLS validation or simply forward traffic.

### Origin Server Flexibility
- **Explicitly define origin servers** for each route.  
- **Combine SuhaibServer’s advanced SNI logic** with your existing setups for maximum compatibility.

---

## Why SuhaibServer?
- **Fine-Grained mTLS Control**: Most reverse proxies only allow mTLS to be toggled on or off globally or at best at the server block level. SuhaibServer’s per-route customization puts you in full control.  
- **SNI-First Logic**: Routing is decided purely on the SNI before any additional overhead—perfect for multi-tenant or complex architectures.  
- **Clear, Modular Configuration**: Each domain or path can have a dedicated set of TLS rules, making your configuration easier to maintain and reason about.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Insert SuhaibServer into your stack without disrupting existing workflows, whether you need pass-through or termination for TLS.

## Getting Started

### 1. Build From Source

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suhaibinator/SuhaibServer.git
   cd SuhaibServer
   ```
2. **Build** the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o suhaibserver ./cmd/main.go
   ```
   (Requires Go 1.24+ or newer.)

3. **Run** the binary with a config file:
   ```bash
   ./suhaibserver /path/to/config.yaml
   ```

### 2. Docker Usage

We publish a Docker image that can be used directly, or you can build it yourself.

#### a) Pull and Run (Hypothetical Example)
```bash
docker pull suhaibinator/suhaibserver:latest
docker run -d \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v /host/certs/:/etc/certs/:ro \
  -v /host/config.yaml:/etc/suhaib/config.yaml:ro \
  suhaibinator/suhaibserver:latest \
  /etc/suhaib/config.yaml
```
- `-v /host/certs/:/etc/certs/:ro` makes certificates available to the container at `/etc/certs/`.
- `-v /host/config.yaml:/etc/suhaib/config.yaml:ro` mounts your config file inside the container.
- The last argument (`/etc/suhaib/config.yaml`) tells SuhaibServer which config file to load.

#### b) Building Your Own Docker Image
If you have cloned the repo, run:
```bash
docker build -t my-suhaibserver .
docker run -d \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v /host/certs/:/etc/certs/:ro \
  -v /host/config.yaml:/etc/suhaib/config.yaml:ro \
  my-suhaibserver:latest \
  /etc/suhaib/config.yaml
```

#### c) Docker Compose Example
You can also use docker compose to manage your SuhaibServer instance, and provide the configuration file as a Docker Config inline:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  suhaibserver:
    image: ghcr.io/suhaibinator/suhaibserver:latest
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    configs:
      - source: suhaibserver_config
        target: /etc/suhaibserver/config.yaml
    volumes:
      - /etc/nginx/ssl/:/etc/certs/:ro
    restart: always

      # Example SuhaibServer Configuration

      # SniSniffer controls how we read the first few bytes of an incoming connection
      # to detect the SNI (Server Name Indication).
      SniSniffer:
        # MaxReadSize is the maximum number of bytes to peek from the client
        # to extract the SNI. If the SNI can't be found within this range,
        # the connection is closed or handled as an error.
        MaxReadSize: 4096

        # Timeout is how long (e.g. 5s, 500ms, etc.) we wait for TLS handshake data
        # when sniffing for SNI. If this timeout is exceeded, we fail the connection.
        Timeout: 5s

      # Backends is a list of per-hostname configurations, each describing
      # how to handle connections to a particular SNI.
      Backends:
        - hostname: example.com

          # If mTLS is enabled, we consult MTLSPolicy to see which paths or
          # queries require (or exclude) client certificates.
          MTLSEnabled: true

          # The MTLSPolicy below means: by default, do NOT require mTLS (Default=false),
          # but invert that default if the path starts with `/admin` or if the query param
          # "token" is present—those routes *will* require mTLS.
          MTLSPolicy:
            Default: false
            Paths:
              - /admin
            Queries:
              - token

          # TerminateTLS=true means SuhaibServer will handle TLS termination locally
          # (i.e., present cert/key) and then forward plain HTTP (or HTTPS) to the Origin.
          TerminateTLS: true
          TLSCertFile: example.com.crt
          TLSKeyFile: example.com.key

          # RootCAFile is used to verify client certificates if mTLS is triggered.
          # If you leave it blank, partial mTLS still works (the handshake won't *force*
          # a client cert). This is just an example path.
          RootCAFile: ca.crt

          # OriginScheme indicates whether to connect to the origin via HTTP or HTTPS.
          OriginScheme: http

          # OriginServer / OriginPort describe where to forward traffic after TLS termination.
          # For example, maybe your app is running on localhost:8080 inside the container.
          OriginServer: 127.0.0.1
          OriginPort: "8080"

        - hostname: foo.bar
          # In this example, we do NOT enable mTLS or TLS termination for foo.bar,
          # which means we do a raw TCP pass-through to the origin.
          MTLSEnabled: false
          TerminateTLS: false

          # Because we are not terminating TLS, these fields are optional or unused:
          # TLSCertFile, TLSKeyFile, RootCAFile
          # They can be omitted or left blank in YAML if you wish.

          # The origin is presumably a TLS-enabled service on 192.168.0.10:443.
          OriginScheme: https
          OriginServer: 192.168.0.10
          OriginPort: "443"

## Example Configuration

Below is an example YAML configuration (`config.example.yaml`). It shows how to:

1. Configure **SNI sniffing** (max read size and handshake timeout).
2. Define one or more **Backends** (one per hostname).
3. Control whether to **terminate TLS**, **enable mTLS**, or **pass-through** raw TCP.

```yaml
# SniSniffer controls how we read the initial bytes of an incoming TLS connection
# to detect the SNI.
SniSniffer:
  MaxReadSize: 4096
  Timeout: 5s

Backends:
  - hostname: example.com
    MTLSEnabled: true
    MTLSPolicy:
      # Default=false => do NOT require mTLS by default
      # But invert the default if the path starts with /admin or the query param "token" is present
      default: false
      paths:
        - /admin
      queries:
        - token
    TerminateTLS: true
    TLSCertFile: example.com.crt
    TLSKeyFile:  example.com.key
    RootCAFile:  ca.crt
    OriginScheme: http
    OriginServer: 127.0.0.1
    OriginPort: "8080"

  - hostname: foo.bar
    MTLSEnabled: false   # no mTLS for foo.bar
    TerminateTLS: false  # pass-through raw TCP
    OriginScheme: https
    OriginServer: 192.168.0.10
    OriginPort: "443"
```

### How Cert Paths Are Resolved
- If a path in the config is not absolute (e.g. `"example.com.crt"`), SuhaibServer can automatically prepend `/etc/certs/` internally (depending on your setup).  
- In Docker, you’d likely mount your certs into the container at `/etc/certs/`.

---

## Usage

```bash
suhaibserver <config-file>
```

- `<config-file>` can be YAML or JSON.  
- The config **must** define `SniSniffer` parameters and at least one `Backend`.  
- Each `Backend` includes:
  - `Hostname` - matches the SNI requested by the client.
  - `TerminateTLS` (true/false).
  - `MTLSEnabled` (true/false) and optional `MTLSPolicy` for partial or conditional mTLS.  
  - `TLSCertFile`, `TLSKeyFile`, `RootCAFile` (paths to certificates/keys).
  - `OriginScheme` (`http` or `https`), plus `OriginServer` and `OriginPort` (where traffic is forwarded).

---

## mTLS Policies

Use `MTLSEnabled: true` to enable partial or full mTLS. Then define `MTLSPolicy` to choose whether mTLS is the **default** or an **exception**:

- **`default: true`**: all paths/queries require a client cert unless they match the listed paths or queries (which become “no-mTLS” exceptions).  
- **`default: false`**: no paths/queries require a client cert unless they match the listed paths or queries (which become “require-mTLS” exceptions).

Examples:
```yaml
MTLSPolicy:
  default: false
  paths:
    - /admin     # routes starting with /admin require mTLS
  queries:
    - token      # any request containing ?token=... in the query string requires mTLS
```
